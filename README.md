# My Personal Project: Spending Tracker

## Summary
This Spending Tracker will help you set a budget, keep track of your expenses, and assist you in reaching your financial goals.
This application is designed mainly for teenagers and university students who want to budget all of their spending and develop better spending habits.
If you are looking to track a shared budget, perhaps with your partner, for a group project, or with your family, this spending tracker
will help you keep track of who spent what.

The reason why I chose to develop this project is because I want to be on top of my finances. 
As a university student, I often find myself in situations where I feel like I am spending too much, 
I don't know where my money is going, or that it is troublesome to keep track of shared spending for a group of people.
I believe that this project will not only be beneficial for myself but also for other people who feel the same way about their finances.
